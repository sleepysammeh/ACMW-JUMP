
# DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT
A website created to solve the problem of ACMW and other clubs which commonly hold quizzes on their online social media platforms but are unable to efficiently track the progress of participants; this program allows participants to access and participate in quizzes with ease.

- Key Features <br>
(i) *Firebase Integration*:  
   Firebase is at the heart of the platform, offering real-time database capabilities that ensure participant data is updated instantaneously during quizzes. Additionally, Firebase Authentication provides secure and seamless user login, ensuring both ease of access and data protection.

(ii) *Node.js Backend*:  
   The backend of this platform is built using Node.js, a powerful, event-driven JavaScript runtime. It facilitates quick and scalable handling of server-side operations, such as quiz submissions, scoring logic, and user management, ensuring a smooth experience even with high traffic.

(iii) *React Frontend*:  
   Built with React, the platform’s user interface is dynamic and highly responsive. React's component-based architecture ensures efficient rendering and allows for modular, reusable UI elements, making it easy to extend or customize functionalities as needed.

(iv) *Tailwind CSS*:  
   Tailwind CSS drives the visual design, offering a utility-first framework for crafting modern, responsive, and visually stunning interfaces. By using pre-built classes, developers can quickly achieve sleek designs without compromising on uniqueness or adaptability.

(iii) Install Dependencies: Navigate to the project directory and run npm install to set up all required packages.
(iv) Run the Project: Use npm start to launch the project on your local server.
(v) Contribute: Push changes and submit pull requests to contribute to the project’s development.

# MENTEE CONTRIBUTION
Samrita: dealt with frontend aspects and learnt tailwind and firebase concepts and applied them. <br>
Mariah: dealt with back-end development and worked with the structure of the program.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
